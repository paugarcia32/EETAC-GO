## Introduction

<p align="justify"> With our application we want both CBL students and people who come to visit the campus to have a good time exploring while creating a community with the chat that is available. In the app there will be different activities that will provide clues, which you will have to complete by searching and using a QR reader to complete them. </p>

<br>

## Programmes

<p align="justify"> These are the working tools we have been using throughout the project: </p>

* <p align="justify"> GitHub: A leading platform for version control, collaboration, and hosting code repositories, empowering seamless teamwork and open-source contributions. </p>

* <p align="justify"> Visual Studio Code: A versatile and feature-rich IDE for efficient coding and development tasks. </p>

* <p align="justify"> MongoDBCompass: A powerful GUI tool for visually exploring and interacting with MongoDB databases. </p>

* <p align="justify"> Docker Hub: A centralized repository for Docker images, simplifying the management and distribution of containerized applications. </p>

* <p align="justify"> Vim: A highly customizable and efficient text editor known for its extensive keyboard shortcuts and command-line capabilities. </p>
